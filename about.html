          <h2>About Cobrettie</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Cobrettie Garner. I am a Full Stack Web Developer, currently located in Central Florida.
            Like some of you, I discovered the field of software engineering much later on in my life, after years of
            chasing many different ideas and dreams. Don't let me fool you, I'm still chasing, however, chasing
            something a
            bit different. We learn as time goes on, or at least we hope to learn, right? Long before my first line of
            code
            was ever written, I was a successful business owner. The business was
            exceeding every expectation I could have ever had. As time passed me by, the wake-up call hit me. I want
            more out of my life. Yes, business was great, but it simply was not what I wanted for the rest of my life,
            and so began the journey of becoming a Software Engineer. I am currently seven months into this journey, and
            I continue to love every single second of it. One of my ultimate goals in life is to create products that
            will better the
            lives of those less fortunate.

          <p>
            Hi, my name is Raymond Thurman. I am a Full Stack Web Developer.
            Before I started at Lambda School I spent ten years in the United
            States Army and led a very successful military career before I was
            medically discharged. Now I am a very ambitious trainee ready for
            the next big career change to come my way. Some of the current
            technologies I use include: HTML5, CSS3, LESS, JavaScript, React,
            and Python.
